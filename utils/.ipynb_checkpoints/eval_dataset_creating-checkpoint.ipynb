It was previously reported that various viruses could interact with the host's ADAR enzymes, resulting in epigenetic changes both to the virus and the host. Here, we analyze RNA-seq of nasopharyngeal swab specimens as well as whole-blood samples of COVID-19 infected individuals and show a significant elevation in the global RNA editing activity in COVID-19 compared to healthy controls. We also detect specific coding sites that exhibit higher editing activity. We further show that the increment in editing activity during the disease is temporary and returns to baseline shortly after the symptomatic period. These significant epigenetic changes may contribute to the immune system response and affect adverse outcomes seen in post-viral cases.. Question: What is the relationship between a covid-10 infection and RNA editing activity?\"\u001b[0m,\n",

Studies were evaluated by two independent reviewers using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria.\\n\\nResults: The search yielded 148 studies for full-text review, of which 21 were included in this systematic review. A total of 10 articles were related to the diagnosis of CHS, while 11 articles discussed the treatment and management of adolescent cases of CHS.\\n\\nConclusions: CHS in the adolescent population fulfills the major and minor diagnostic criteria of CHS in the adult population; however, in adolescent patients, CHS may present more frequently in females, with the earliest reported case presenting at age 15 years. There appears to be a substantial proportion \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m21%\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m of adolescent patients diagnosed with CHS that have a history of anxiety and depression; however, higher quality studies to assess the prevalence are warranted.

There is often a delayed diagnosis due to its non-specific clinical presentation. This leads to stalled acquisition of confirmatory diagnostic imaging with resultant increased morbidity and mortality. Congenital or acquired absence of the left kidney results in loss of the splenorenal ligament, a key ligament to maintain normal splenic position in the abdomen.

While in most cases of congenital forms of lipodystrophy a genetic alteration can be identified, the pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the acquired diseases are not fully clarified. Based on the evidence of a positive association between most acquired lipodystrophies and autoimmune disorders including immune mediated alterations in the adipose tissue of patients affected by acquired lipodystrophy, a reaction against white adipose tissue antigens is postulated. Recent acquisitions have shed new light on the possible pathogenic mechanisms and identified novel forms of acquired lipodystrophy which are possibly immune-mediated. The aim of this review is to give an update on acquired lipodystrophies describing pathogenic mechanisms involved and the relationships between acquired lipodystrophies and other autoimmune disorders.

The symptoms have a negative influence on both their physical health and quality of life. The cost of treatment has a significant impact on the disease\\'s burden. Even though its origin is uncertain, estrogen is thought to be a key player in fibroid pathophysiology. Many theories, including those based on genetic and environmental factors, explain what causes hyper-estrogenic condition in fibroid patients. One such possibility that is currently being explored is the hypothesis that an altered gut microbiome can contribute to the development of diseases characterized by estrogen dominance. Gut dysbiosis is often a \"hot area\" in the health sciences. According to a recent study, uterine fibroid patients have altered gut microbiome. A variety of risk factors influence both fibroid development and gut homeostasis. Diet, lifestyle, physical activity, and environmental contaminants have an impact on estrogen and the gut flora. A better understanding of uterine fibroids\\' pathophysiology is required to develop effective preventative and treatment options.

Context: Geriatric syndromes are symptoms and signs, such as falls, incontinence, delirium, pressure ulcers, dysphagia and so on, that often threaten the independence of older adults, rather than the disease itself. Although the syndromes are very common in older people, it is difficult to treat those by modern medicine due to their complexity. To mitigate the intractable geriatric symptoms, we review the efficacy of aromatherapy, especially for dysphagia, dyspnea, cognitive dysfunction and falls in geriatric syndrome. Olfactory stimulation using a volatile black pepper oil on institutional residents improved the swallowing reflex, which is a crucial risk factor of aspiration pneumonia. Brain imaging study showed that olfactory stimulation using volatile black pepper oil activated cerebral regions of the anterior cingulate and the insular cortex, which play a role in controlling appetite and swallowing. Also, aromatherapy with volatile l-menthol decreased the sense of dyspnea and improved the efficacy of exercise therapy. The fragrance of the combination of rosemary and lemon oils in the morning, and the combination of lavender and orange oils in the night-time were reported to improve cognition and behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, respectively. Also, the combination of lavender and lemon balm oils was reported to be effective for irritability-related agitation in older adults. Furthermore, aromatherapy with lavender fragrance could improve both static and dynamic balance, resulting in a reduction in the number of fallers and the incidence rate in older people. Thus, aromatherapy is a promising remedy for geriatric syndrome. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2021; 21: 377-385..

Context: Human cell survival requires function of the Na+/K+ pump; the heteromeric protein that hydrolyzes ATP to extrude Na+ and import K+ across the plasmalemma, thereby building and maintaining these ions' electrochemical gradients. Numerous dominant diseases caused by mutations in genes encoding for Na+/K+ pump catalytic \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mα\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m subunit isoforms highlight the importance of this protein. Here, we review literature describing disorders caused by missense mutations in ATP1A1, the gene encoding the ubiquitously expressed α1 isoform of the Na+/K+ pump. These various maladies include primary aldosteronism with secondary hypertension, an endocrine syndrome, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a peripheral neuropathy, complex spastic paraplegia, another neuromuscular disorder, as well as hypomagnesemia accompanied by seizures and cognitive delay, a condition affecting the renal and central nervous systems. This article focuses on observed commonalities among these mutations' functional effects, as well as on the special characteristics that enable each particular mutation to exclusively affect a certain system, without affecting others. In this respect, it is clear how somatic mutations localized to adrenal adenomas increase aldosterone production without compromising other systems. However, it remains largely unknown how and why some but not all de novo germline or familial mutations \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mwhere the mutant must be expressed in numerous tissues\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m produce a specific disease and not the other diseases.

We found evidence that SPIN4 binds specific histone modifications, promotes canonical WNT signaling, and inhibits cell proliferation in vitro and that the identified frameshift variant had lost all of these functions. Ablation of Spin4 in mice recapitulated the human phenotype with generalized overgrowth, including increased longitudinal bone growth. Growth plate analysis revealed increased cell proliferation in the proliferative zone and an increased number of progenitor chondrocytes in the resting zone. We also found evidence of decreased canonical Wnt signaling in growth plate chondrocytes, providing a potential explanation for the increased number of resting zone chondrocytes. Taken together, our findings provide strong evidence that SPIN4 is an epigenetic reader that negatively regulates mammalian body growth and that loss of SPIN4 causes an overgrowth syndrome in humans, expanding our knowledge of the epigenetic regulation of human growth..

Thus, researchers search for more evidence to cross-check their results through different sources. To provide the researchers with alternative and complementary low-cost disease-gene association evidence, computational approaches come into play. Since molecular networks are able to capture complex interplay among molecules in diseases, they become one of the most extensively used data for disease-gene association prediction. In this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of network-based methods for disease gene prediction. We also conduct an empirical analysis on 14 state-of-the-art methods.

In this systematic review, we identified that 1.5-4.5% of TIAs present as SWS and despite this occurrence, little is known about management strategies and treatment outcomes. Various mechanisms including small vessel disease, artery to artery embolism, hemodynamic instability and periinfarct depolarization may account for its nature. There are no specific guidelines on treatment, but thrombolysis appears safe but does not necessarily provide an advantage over antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation in preventing recurrences. Regardless of treatment, SWS is associated with excellent clinical outcomes.\\n\\n '\u001b[0m\u001b[39m,\u001b[0m\n",

CPS are particularly relevant to pediatric surgeons since nearly 10% of cancer diagnoses are due to inherited genetic traits, and CPS often contribute to cancer development during childhood.\\n\\nMaterials/methods: The English language literature was searched for manuscripts, practice guidelines, and society statements on \"cancer predisposition syndromes in children\". Following review of these manuscripts and cross-referencing of their bibliographies, tables were created to summarize findings of the most common CPS associated with surgically treated pediatric solid malignancies.\\n\\nResults: Pediatric surgeons should be aware of CPS as the identification of one of these syndromes can completely change the management of certain tumors, such as WT. The most common CPS associated with pediatric solid malignancies are outlined, with an emphasis on those most often encountered by pediatric surgeons: neuroblastoma, Wilms\\' tumor, hepatoblastoma, and medullary thyroid cancer. Frequently associated non-tumor manifestations of these CPS are also included as a guide to increase surgeon awareness. Screening and management guidelines are outlined, and published genetic testing and counseling guidelines are included where available.\\n\\nConclusion: Pediatric surgeons play an important role as surgical oncologists and are often the first point of contact for children with solid tumors. In their role of delivering a diagnosis and developing a follow-up and treatment plan as part of a multidisciplinary team, familiarity with common CPS will ensure evidence-based practices are followed, including important principles such as organ preservation and intensified surveillance plans.

Unlike the DDS-associated conditions, in our cases DACS is not pharmacologically induced, being that all patients were L-dopa-free. We detected a diffuse hyperintensity of the white matter and brain atrophy, with insular shrinkage as well as ventricular system and/or sub-arachnoid space enlargement in our DACS patients. Furthermore, similarly to the other behavioral symptoms of dementia, DACS also seems to be correlated to the degree of cognitive and functional impairment, rather than its subtype. In conclusion, DACS is a non-cognitive, unpublished clinical aspect of evolved dementia, which is interesting due to the involvement of the extra-nigral dopaminergic system, resulting in an unabating altered behavior, but also to the enrichment of our knowledge in the involutional diseases of the central nervous system and their physiopathological manifestations..

It is characterized by dyspnea and hypoxemia triggered by standing and relieved with recumbency. The diagnosis is predominately clinical. The degree of hypoxemia is variable; however, the diagnostic criteria include the decrease in arterial oxygen pressure more than 4 mmHg or oxygen saturation more than 5%. Even though many diseases cause this syndrome, there are only two responsible mechanisms, intracardiac, and intrapulmonary shunts. The coexistence of diverse structural and physiological abnormalities joined to gravitational forces that induce blood shunt after standing is crucial in each mechanism. The intracardiac mechanism is characterized by right to left blood shunt through atrial septal communications and, the right atrium pressure could be normal or increased. In addition, some patients have one or more coexistent aortic, spinal, or intracardiac alterations. The intrapulmonary mechanism is less frequent and is caused by parenchymal or vascular pathologies. Transthoracic echocardiogram is the first diagnostic modality; however, understanding the pathophysiology is the key for a rational diagnostic approach and subsequent diagnostic studies. Treatment is possible and effective in the majority of intracardiac mechanisms and some intrapulmonary. This review focuses on the pathophysiologic mechanisms of POS and their diagnostic workup..

Context: Melanoma is the deadliest type of skin cancer characterized by high cellular heterogeneity, which contributes to therapy resistance and unpredictable disease outcome. Recently, by correlating reflectance confocal microscopy morphology with histopathological type, we identified four distinct melanoma subtypes: dendritic cell, round cell, dermal nest, and combined-type melanomas. In this study, each reflectance confocal microscopy melanoma subtype expressed a specific biomolecular profile and biological behavior in vitro. Markers of tumor aggressiveness, including Ki-67, MERTK, nestin, and stemness markers were highest in the most invasive combined-type and dermal nest melanomas than in dendritic cell and round cell melanomas. This was also confirmed in multicellular tumor spheroids. Transcriptomic analysis showed modulation of cancer progression-associated genes from dendritic cell to combined-type melanomas. The switch from E- to N-cadherin expression proved the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition from dendritic cell to combined-type subtypes. The dermal nest melanoma was predominantly located in the dermis, as also shown in skin reconstructs. It displayed a unique behavior and a molecular profile associated with a high degree of aggressiveness. Altogether, our results show that each reflectance confocal microscopy melanoma subtype has a distinct biological and gene expression profile related to tumor aggressiveness, confirming that reflectance confocal microscopy can be a dependable tool for in vivo detection of different types of melanoma and for early diagnostic screening..

She had been suffering from severe dysmenorrhea and general fatigue monthly.\\n\\nResults: A forensic autopsy revealed indications of a bicorporeal uterus, obstructed hemi-vagina, and ipsilateral renal agenesis, which lead to a diagnosis of obstructed hemi-vagina and ipsilateral renal anomaly \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mOHVIRA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m syndrome. On the right side of the uterus, an enclosed cavity composed of black clots was observed. Histological findings suggested that her endometrium was in the early proliferative phase, implying that she was in the menstrual phase just before her death. She may have been suffering from severe lower abdominal pain from the increased pressure of the closed uterus cavity.\\n\\nConclusions: This case indicates that dysmenorrhea from undiagnosed OHVIRA syndrome can possibly lead to a suicide attempt. In Japan, because suicide was the leading cause of death for people aged 15 to 39 in 2019, preventive measures for suicide should be promoted. The present case also suggests that intervention for dysmenorrhea may prevent this in adolescent woman.. Question: Can undetected OHVIRA lead to suicide?'\u001b[0m,\n",

Context: The inherited thrombocytopenia syndromes are a group of disorders characterized primarily by quantitative defects in platelet number, though with a variety demonstrating qualitative defects and/or extrahematopoietic findings. Through collaborative international efforts applying next-generation sequencing approaches, the list of genetic syndromes that cause thrombocytopenia has expanded significantly in recent years, now with over 40 genes implicated. In this review, we focus on what is known about the genetic etiology of inherited thrombocytopenia syndromes and how the field has worked to validate new genetic discoveries. We highlight the important role for the clinician in identifying a germline genetic diagnosis and strategies for identifying novel causes through research-based endeavors..

Moreover, it may progress to acute myocardial infarction or even cardiac arrest. Therefore, clinicians should improve their understanding of this ECG pattern and appropriately dilate the coronary angiography indication. In addition, more dangerous narrowing of a coronary artery, as in our case, the left main artery stenosis, should also be considered..

Context: Introduction: Tuberculosis \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mTB\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m is a fatal disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mM.TB\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m with over eight million annual mortality reported worldwide attributed to the disease's direct or indirect effects. Among the most severe form of M. TB is an infection of the Central nervous system \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mCNS-TB\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. This infection is characterized by meningitis, tuberculoma, and tuberculous brain abscess. Tuberculomas are the most common variety of intracranial parenchymal tuberculosis. They occur because of conglomeration and conjugation of tubercular microgranulomas, which tend to occur at the grey-white matter junction due to the arrest of the hematogenous disseminating microbes caused by a decrease in the caliber of vessels in that region. Intracranial tuberculoma shows central hypointensity compared to grey matter, seeing this centrally on T2W images is helpful, as it is not seen in most other ring-enhancing lesions.\\n\\nObjectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the findings of the magnetic resonance imaging \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mMRI\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m scan of patients with intracranial tuberculoma using retrospective hospital records.\\n\\nMethodology: We conducted a retrospective data analysis of 73 patients with an age range of 3-70 years between 2018 and 2021 who were diagnosed with intracranial tuberculoma using MRI features at the Radiology Department, Somali-Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan Hospital. All the patients' MRI were evaluated, including conventional and contrast sequences and as well as MR diffusion.\\n\\nResults: This study revealed that most tuberculoma patients were female with 43 \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m58.9%\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m and 30 \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m41.1%\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m male.
